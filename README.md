Bindings to [libnotify](https://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/) library

Note that although the bindings are distributed under MIT license *everything* else is GPLed.
And by everything I mean everything: glib, libnotify, haskell bindings to glib, and so forth.
That effectively means that by using libnotify bindings you agree your project is GPLed too.
Sorry about that!
